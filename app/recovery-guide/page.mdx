# Complete Recovery Code Process Guide

## What is a Recovery Code?

A recovery code is a unique identifier that allows you to save and restore your progress in the Cyber Essentials preparation guide. Think of it as a digital bookmark that remembers exactly where you left off.

## How to Use Recovery Codes

### Generating a Recovery Code

1. Click on the "Get Recovery Code" button in the navigation bar
2. The system automatically generates a unique recovery code for you
3. Your current progress is saved and associated with this code
4. The code remains valid for 30 days from generation

### Saving Your Recovery Code

1. When you see your recovery code, click the "Copy" button to copy it to your clipboard
2. Save this code somewhere secure - in a password manager, notes app, or write it down
3. You'll need this exact code to restore your progress later

### Restoring Your Progress

1. When you return to the guide (on any device or browser), click "Get Recovery Code"
2. Select the "Restore Progress" tab in the dialog
3. Enter your previously saved recovery code
4. Click "Continue" to validate the code
5. If the code is valid and has associated progress data, your previous progress will be restored
6. You'll see a success message confirming your progress has been restored

### Generating a New Code

1. If you need a new recovery code, click "Get Recovery Code" 
2. Select the "View Code" tab
3. Click "Generate New Code"
4. This creates a new unique code and associates your current progress with it
5. Your previous code becomes invalid

## Important Notes

- Recovery codes expire after 30 days
- Always generate and save a new code before your current one expires
- Each recovery code is unique and can only be used to restore the progress that was saved with it
- If you lose your recovery code, you cannot recover your previous progress
- Generating a new code invalidates your previous code

Remember to save your recovery code in a secure location that you can access later!
